                <p>This Cookie Policy (“Cookie Policy”) is a part of and incorporated within and is to be read along with the Privacy Policy (“Policy”) and Term of Use. The capitalized terms used in this Cookie Policy, but not defined herein, shall have the meaning given to such terms in the Privacy Policy.</p>
                <p>What are cookies and local storage?</p>
                <p>Cookies are small text files that are placed on your browser or device by websites, apps, online media, and advertisements. There are different types of cookies. Cookies served by the entity that operates the domain you are visiting are called “first party cookies.” So, cookies served by Swiggy while you are on the Swiggy Platform are first party cookies. Cookies served by companies that are not operating the domain you are visiting are called “third party cookies.” For eg., we may allow Google to set a cookie on your browser while you visit the Swiggy Platform, and that would be a third party cookie. Cookies may also endure for different periods of time. “Session Cookies” only last only as long as your browser is open. These are deleted automatically once you close your browser. Other cookies are “persistent cookies” meaning that they survive after your browser is closed. For example, they may recognize your device when you re-open your browser and browse the internet again.</p>
                <p>“Pixel tags” (also called beacons or pixels) are small blocks of code installed on (or called by) a webpage, app, or advertisement which can retrieve certain information about your device and browser, including for example: device type, operating system, browser type and version, website visited, time of visit, referring website, IP address, and other similar information, including the small text file (the cookie) that uniquely identifies the device. Pixels provide the means by which third parties can set and read browser cookies from a domain that they do not themselves operate and collect information about visitors to that domain, typically with the permission of the domain owner.</p>
                <p>Local storage is a technology that allows a website or application to store information locally on your device. “Software Development Kits” (also called SDKs) function like pixels and cookies, but operate in the mobile app context where pixels and cookies cannot always function. The primary app developer can install pieces of code (the SDK) from partners in the app, and thereby allow the partner to collect certain information about user interaction with the app and information about the user device and network information.</p>
                <p>Why do we use these technologies?</p>
                <p>We use cookies and other identification technologies for various purposes, including: authenticating users,store information about you (including on your device or in your browser cache) and your use of our Services and the Swiggy Platform, remembering user preferences and settings, determining the popularity of content, delivering and measuring the effectiveness of advertising campaigns, analyzing site traffic and trends, and generally understanding the online behaviors and interests of people who interact with our Services.</p>
